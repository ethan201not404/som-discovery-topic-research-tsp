# Spirit of Math (SOM) Competitive Contest Coaching Club 2023-2024

## Discovery Topics Research Project

Throughout this club, the students will discover advanced mathematical concepts through collaborative research. Students will dive deep into these topics with their group members to develop a greater understanding and present their findings to the club.

The purpose of the Discovery Topics is not only to achieve a deeper mathematical understanding of the topic, but also to gain communication skills, presentation skills, time management skills, and research experience.

The outcome of the Discovery Topics will include a LaTeX paper where the students can share what they have learned. 

This might include the following items:
- Introduction
- History/Background
- What problem exists that this topic is trying to solve?
- Explanation of the math used in this topic
- 4 or 5 of your own examples related to this topic, with full solutions
- How this topic is used to solve problems today
- Conclusion

The presentation should be 10 – 15 minutes in length and include examples for the class to try during the presentation. (In May 2024)

## Group Research Project Topic - The Travelling Salesman Problem

The LaTex to generate the reseach papper in PDF is avalible via overleaf online: [SOM Travelling Salesman Problem](https://www.overleaf.com/project/65da3fa83ac417f68cfed8d9).

My contribution to the group was focused on the __Brute Force Approach__ and written in LaTex. 
I also prepared a Pokémon Poké Stop map using sample HTML code to effectively demonstrate the problem via the Brute Force Approach. 
Detailed information is available [here](https://github.com/ethan201not404/som-discovery-topic-research-tsp/tree/main/PokemonMap).

Thank you to Ms. Bonnie McLoughlin for her guidance, and to my entire team for their hard work in making this possible. It has been both a fun and highly educational experience.
