# Spirit of Math - Competitive Contest Coaching Club 2023-2024

### Discovery Topics Research Project

Throughout this course, students will discover advanced mathematical concepts through
collaborative research. Students will dive deep into these topics with their group members to
develop a greater understanding and present their findings to the club.
The purpose of the Discovery Topics is not only to achieve a deeper mathematical
understanding of the topic, but also to gain communication skills, presentation skills, time
management skills, and research experience.

The outcome of the Discovery Topics will include a LaTeX paper where the students can share
what they have learned. This might include the following items:

- Introduction
- History/Background
- What problem exists that this topic is trying to solve?
- Explanation of the math used in this topic
- 4 or 5 of your own examples related to this topic, with full solutions
- How this topic is used to solve problems today
- Conclusion

The presentation should be 10 â€“ 15 minutes in length and include examples for the class to
try during the presentation.
